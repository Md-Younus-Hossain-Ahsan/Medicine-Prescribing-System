## Motivation Behind the Project

- **Doctors' sloppy handwriting:** Sloppy handwriting by doctors poses serious risks, leading to potential harm or even death for patients. Clear and legible documentation is crucial for ensuring patient safety in healthcare. [Reference Link](https://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1578074,00.html)
- **Prescription Continuity Challenge:** Sometimes patients forget to bring the previous prescription at the time of their next appointment, which poses challenges in creating subsequent prescriptions.


## System Requirements

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Framework:** Java Swing
- **Database:** MySQL

## Key Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** The application provides a simple and intuitive user interface using Java Swing for efficient interaction.

- **Prescription Management:** Doctors can easily prescribe and manage medications for patients, including commonly prescribed medicines and tests.

- **Patient Details:** Store and retrieve comprehensive patient details, making it convenient for doctors to access relevant information.

- **Prescription History:** Track and review the prescription history of patients to make informed decisions during consultations. If a patient forgets their previous prescription, our system allows the doctor to quickly find and review it, ensuring a smooth and informed medical consultation.

- **Searching Suggestions:** During prescription creation, our system offers smart searching suggestions by retrieving medicine, test, finding problems, and advice lists from the database, streamlining the process for doctors.
